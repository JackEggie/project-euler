## [Even Fibonacci numbers](https://projecteuler.net/problem=2)

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

## Solution

Answer: 4613732

```java
int a = 1;
int b = 2;

int sum = b;

int i = 3;
while (a <= 4_000_000 && b <= 4_000_000) {
	if (i % 2 == 0) {
		b += a;
		if (b % 2 == 0) {
			sum += b;
		}
	} else {
		a += b;
		if (a % 2 == 0) {
			sum += a;
		}
	}
	i++;
}
return sum;
```

Find all the even-valued terms from small to large and sum them.
