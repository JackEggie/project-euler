## [Highly divisible triangular number](https://projecteuler.net/problem=12)

The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the 7th triangle number would be $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28$. The first ten terms would be:

$$1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...$$

Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:

```text
 1: 1
 3: 1,3
 6: 1,2,3,6
10: 1,2,5,10
15: 1,3,5,15
21: 1,3,7,21
28: 1,2,4,7,14,28
```

We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.

What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?

## Solution

Answer: 76576500

```java
long i = 1;
long sum = i;
TreeMap<Long, Integer> factors;
while (true) {
	i++;
	sum += i;
	factors = MathUtil.getPrimeFactors(sum);
	int count = 1;
	for (Map.Entry<Long, Integer> entry : factors.entrySet()) {
		count *= entry.getValue() + 1;
	}
	if (count > 500) {
		return sum;
	}
}
```

## Discussion

First, calculate the prime factors of the triangular numbers and their power exponents. Then we can get the count of factors by each power exponent plus 1 and multiply together, for we should take the condition of power exponent equals 0 into consideration.
